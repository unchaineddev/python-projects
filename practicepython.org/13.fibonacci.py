# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate 
# and then generates them. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of 
# numbers in the sequence to generate.
# (Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number 
# in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. 
# The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
